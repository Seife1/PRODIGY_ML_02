# Customer Segmentation
 
 In this task I will demonstrate customer segmentation concepts , also known as market basket analysis by using unsupervised ML technique (**K-Means Clustering Algorithm with Elbow Method**) in the simplest form.

 <p>K-means clustering is an unsupervised learning algorithm used to partition a dataset into K distinct clusters. Hereâ€™s an overview of how it works, its steps,</p>

 This popular technique divides data points into clusters according to how similar they are.  The process begins by selecting the number of clusters (k) to identify, Next, k points are randomly selected to serve as the initial centroids of the clusters. After that, each data point is matched with the closest centroid to create k clusters. The Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS) is used to evaluate the cluster quality, and the centroids are recalculated as the mean of all the points in each cluster. Until the centroids stabilise, signifying convergence, this iterative process is continued.
